:-I have used youtube-playlist-summary to get the data of a playlist form youtube and store the data in Backend( MongoDb ) which you can get by clicking the fetch button.<br>
:-You can also upload a pdf and give some extra data in the pdf along with the playlist Id, all the data of excel sheet and playlist ID will be stored in the backend and you can fetch it using fetch from sheet.
